            When I arrived in Stirling to study Sociology and Film in 2014, one of the first things I realised I
            needed to figure out is how to source good bread. Having grown up in Vienna, Austria, with bread
            as a real staple in my diet, I was used to a wide variety of wholesome sourdough loaves to be
            available to me at all times. I arrived at a good time – Théo, Nils and Tom were already head to toe
            in the dough, and Riverside Bakery was in the making. I quickly became one of the bakery’s
            keenest supporters, firstly simply out of a personal need for bread, but gradually I realised that this
            was about something bigger, and my eyes were opened to a whole range of issues that were more to
            do with politics than simply with eating. Realising that this was a project I wanted to put my time
            and energy into, I started volunteering both as a bicycle delivery person and a baker. I gained a real
            sense of purpose from my involvement with the bakery, and doing something with my hands was
            extremely rewarding and something I didn’t get to experience very much as a university student. At
            the time it was mainly Théo doing the baking, and as I became more confident I started replacing
            him for entire shifts and so the apprentice volunteer became and employee. Then, early 2020, Théo
            and Ahley decided to leave Stirling and I excitedly agreed to take on the bakery with the
            commitment to keep Théo’s, Nils’, Tom’s and Ashley’s dream going with the same ethos an

            I’m an Italian fella obsessed with good food and good bread. I grew up in a small town in the Alps,
            where growing your own food and baking your own bread was the norm – fresh, delicious,
            homemade bread was always available at home and I’ve been kneading since I was tall enough to
            reach the counter standing on a chair.
            Although I had been baking for a long time, it was not until I came to Scotland in 2017 that I dared
            to explore the world of sourdough baking, an art that had always been surrounded by a veil of
            mystery for me, but also one I quickly embraced as soon as I received some 3-generations old
            sourdough starter from a sourdough baking workshop at the Green and Blue Space.
            When I first started experimenting with sourdough it was all about the new texture and flavour of
            the bread and the technicalities involved with sourdough baking but soon after that I realised that
            there was more to it. I realised that just like growing our own food back home, sourdough baking
            and supporting local farmers and mills was an act of rebellion and a step in the right direction for a
            more sustainable future. So I started sharing my sourdough starter and bread knowledge with all my
            friends and family, watched how it brought people together and how their enthusiasm spread across
            communities. Some of it travelled all the way to Bogotá, Colombia. Just before Théo left, I started
            volunteering as a baker at Riverside Bakery, where I really boosted my baking skills and met with
            wonderful people. After a few months of being a keen volunteer and apprentice, I took on the role
            of Menstrual Man and officially became an employee in September 2020.

            <img class="about_image" src="/assets/images/profiles/theo.jpg" alt="Théo picture" />I have been making bread since I arrived in Stirling as a student in 2011. Starting to make
            my own sourdough bread has been a true eye opener to the whole topic of food systems and sustainability. Along this path, I have met fantastic people and discovered
            fascinating projects like Bread Matters, Scotland the Bread and more.<br />A milestone in my development as a community supported baker was taking part in the 2014
            ‘Baking for Community’ course at <a href="http://breadmatters.com/" title="bread_matters">Bread Matters</a>. These 4 days opened up new horizons and truly decided me to
            work towards a community-supported bakery project. Since then I ran Bread workshops, baked for community events, and started the Riverside Bakery Project with Nils and
            Tom.<br />Bread making, in addition to being a great tangible and practical skill, has got this incredible power to bring people together, it is also an opportunity to
            offer something different to the those around you, it is simple in its making, easy to give, and yet has such complex implications!<br />The whole bakery project has
            been a great adventure and I’m excited to see it continue

                    I'm a passionate advocate for a re-imagined Scottish food system. A food system that has thriving farmers and food producers at it's centre, one that builds vibrant communities and produces food for people that is ecologically and socially just. My professional background is in community engagement surrounding sustainable food – with a hefty dose of innovative gardening and farming thrown in too. <br/>
                    
                    My interest in Real Bread began when I moved to the UK, and chanced upon Andrew Whitley's book “Bread Matters”. Although I had been sustainable-food-obsessed for a good number of years before that, I didn't realise just how far modern bread had veered off of its original course – from being a simple, nutritious part of the UK diet, one that requires no funny additives and just flour, water, salt, culture, and time – to something I wouldn't necessarily call bread today! <br/>
                    
                    I started working for the Food Education at Stirling university (FEAST) project at Stirling University Students' Union in the summer of 2014. It was here I met Théo, Tom and Nils, and started to learn about the wondrous process of sourdough bread making, and getting to taste all their amazing bread creations. From the beginning, I was always the fledgling home bakery's biggest advocate - evidenced by myself enthusiastically and constantly talking everyone’s ear off about sourdough and the bakery!<br/>
                    
                    Not much has changed today, where I still sing the praises of sourdough and the Bakery, but now in different roles - as one of the Directors, an apprentice baker, and the communications lady. I am keen to learn all aspects of the baking, and I am learning more with each 4 am rise and cycle to the bakery. I strongly believe that only good things can come from getting communities empowered to engage in their food system. This is why I really love and want to support the Community Interest Company structure of the Bakery – an innovative model that ensures the Bakery is run for, and by, the community. To this end, I'm keenly listening out for any suggestions, criticisms, ideas and revelations from you about Riverside Bakery – please get in touch!

From the bread point of view that is. Well, what better solution than to start making my own? In September 2014 I moved in with Théo and Nils and from our mutual passion for food, baking and bread developed the Riverside Bakery.

    <h4>Brief history:</h4>
    <p>
        Riverside Bakery is a project which started in September 2014, from the cooperation of three amateur and passionate bakers: Théo, Tom and Nils who wished to make handmade
        bread available to the local community. We moved into our house in Riverside in the summer of 2014 and started making bread from home nearly immediately, experimenting with
        recipes from our respective countries of origin (France, Czech Republic and Germany).
    </p>

    <p>
        After a couple of months, and repeated requests, we decided to start collecting email addresses from interested folks. This would be the start of our bread order scheme,
        sometimes called ‘Bread Club’ by other bakeries. We would send our newsletter at the beginning of the week, announcing what type of bread would be available, and where it
        could be picked up from, people could then order it and pick it up on the Thursday either from our place in Riverside, or on the Stirling University Campus.
    </p>

    <p>
        The fact that we were from student backgrounds gave rise to developments at the University, notably with the Green and Blue Space, a Climate Challenge Fund initiative of
        the Students Union focussing on reducing waste, and on our relationship to food on campus (community garden, food workshops, food cooperative etc.). The Students Union
        showed interest in our project from the start, and offered us resources to allow us to continue and prosper. Our cooperation with them is still going to this day, and the
        Food Hive Cooperative remains one of our 'Bread points'. We also started growing the project to reach out to the more permanent, local community in Stirling itself. This
        started with the support of Transition Stirling, which accomplished a lot in the way of community-based initiatives and promoting and strengthening a local food network. In
        January 2014, we set up another bread point with the Cycle Hub (Forth Environment Link), when they decided to launch 'Foodie Fridays'.
    </p>

    <p>
        In 2015 we were awarded a grant from Firstport, and decided to take the bakery to the next level and incorporated as a Community Interest Company (CIC), which is a form of
        social enterprise with 'locked assets' and a 'social mission' which directs how to spend our surplus. In the summer 2015, the bakery got in touch with the Hillview
        Community Centre Association, and we decided to settle for premises in the kitchen there.
